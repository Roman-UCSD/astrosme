# AstroSME

**AstroSME** is a Python library to simulate the effects of physics beyond the Standard Model on the polarization state of photons arriving from astronomical sources according to the Standard Model Extension (SME) framework, search for SME effects in observed polarimetry and simulate potential bias imposed on the polarimetric measurements by the dust in the Milky Way.

The code was developed by [Roman Gerasimov](https://cass.ucsd.edu/index.php/grads:Rgerasimov) and [Andrew Friedman](https://asfriedman.physics.ucsd.edu/) at University of California San Diego.
